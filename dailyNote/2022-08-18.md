All of my actions have inertia. This means I can do it without putting in more effort. However, it is also difficult to stop and change direction. This thought makes me decide what I should do. 

However, knowledge and action are different. Some people call it the combination of two wisdom.  I need to take action to turn my knowledge into wisdom.

Today I won't be able to fix many bad habits in one day. However, I will change my bad habits no matter how long it will take. Because I believe my inertia.

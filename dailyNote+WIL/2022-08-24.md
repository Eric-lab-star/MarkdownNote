- next js Image Component and Image Optimization 
### Features of the Image component
The image component of NextJS provides many built-in performance optimizations. These features help to achieve better "Core Web Vitals", "Google's Search rankings", and user experience. 

Some of the optimizations built into the image component include:

- improved Performance:  always serve correctly-sized images for each device.
- Visual Stability: prevents cumulative layout shift
- Faster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport, with optional blur-up placeholders.
- Asset Flexibility: on-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers.
- 
## 16.1
### Local Images
```js
import profilePic from '../public/me.png'
```
The import must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.
The width and the height of the image will be automatically determined based.



## 16.2
### Remote Images
src must be a URL string either absolute or relative.
```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image
        src="/me.png"
        alt="Picture of the author"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

## 16.3 
### Layout 
layout fill and object-fit property
```jsx
<div className="h-80 relative">
	<Image
	src={getImageDelivelyURL(data.product.image, "public")}
	alt="product"
	layout="fill"
	className="object-scale-down"
	priority
	/>
</div>
```
The image component with layout fill property takes all space from a relative parent. By defining the height of the relative parent, the Image component will automatically adjust its size.

## Canvas 
I am behind my schedule studying  Canvas I need to hurry up and don't be lazy.

### Things to be improved 

In this section I am writing  items that should be improved.

1. My learning speed is too slow. 
2. I am not following my schedule. 
3. Don't have time to make notes.


I am trying to follow my schedule but, I am often spending more time than I should. One way to fix this is to give enough time for each scheduled items, but I don't want fix this way. Because, what I want to do is improve faster day by day. Giving more time to me will make myself lazy person or slow learner. 

### How to improve
1. Wake up earlier.
2. Be aware of time. 
3. Don't waste time.

By waking up earlier, I can learn more in one day compare to waking up late, if I don't go to sleep early.  Maybe I am not focusing on the work, therefore, aware of time will help me to focuse on the work at the assigned time.

To improve faster it is very important to make notes. Please review it at the end of the day and beginning of the day.

### TMR I will be..
TMR I will wake up at 7:00 am. I will be aware of time.
